# Dynamic Programming

## Introduction

## Components

- Memoization
- Recursion
- Enumeration
- State machine
- State transitioning
- Sub problems

### Big ideas

- Top down approach
  - Recursive tree search with caching
- Bottom up approach

## Intuition

- Brute force

## Common tricks for optimization

- Loop backwards to reduce using additional space

## Beware of these pitfalls

- Getting the wrong state transition equation

## Practice

### Pattern recognition: When to use DP?

- Optimization problems
  - Maximization, minimization
    - Keywords to look out for: Longest, shortest, maximum, minimum, best, largest, smallest etc.
    - Examples:
      - Knapsack problem
      - Stock picking problems
  - Combinatorial enumeration problems
    - Find all of something, find total
    - Examples:
      - How many ways to climb a flight of stairs
      - How many ways to find a number
