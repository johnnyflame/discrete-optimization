# Discrete Optimization

This is a repository containing notes and explanation of various useful concepts and techniques for solving optimization problems.

## List of techniques covered. 

* Dynamic programming
* Branch and bound
* Constraint programming
* Local Search
* Mixed Integer Programming


## Reference
Many of these ideas are notes taken from Coursera's Discrete Optimization course.(Very awesome course, this is a course I would recommend to anyone interested in improving their problem solving abilities)

As part of the Coursera honor code, this repository will not contain any assignment code.
