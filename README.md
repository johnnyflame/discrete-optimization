# A roadmap of algorithms

Notes and explanation of various algorithm and data structure concepts. Ranging from beginner topics to advanced optimization techniques.

## Why study algorithms?

- A great way to add value to your software product or service.
- Improve your day to day work on the job
- Improve your position in the job market

## Beginner tier

- Concepts
  - Divide and conquer
  - Recursion
  - Dynamic programming
- Search
  - Binary search
  - DFS
  - BFS
- Recursion
  - Tree traversal
    - Pre, post, level order
- Sorting algorithms
  - Simple sorts:
    - Insertion sort
    - Selection sort
  - N log N sorts:
    - Quicksort
    - Mergesort
    - Heapsort

## Intermediate tier

- Search
  - Backtracking
  - Branch and bound
  - Constraint programming
- Sort
  - Non-comparison sorts
    - Radix sort
    - Counting sort
    - Bucket sort
- Dynamic programming

## Advanced topics

Often these are for solving NP-complete problems.

- String processing
  - KMP
  - Boyce Moore
  - Manacher's algorithm
- Optimization
  - Dynamic programming
  - Branch and bound

## List of techniques covered.

- Dynamic programming
- Branch and bound
- Constraint programming
- Local Search
- Mixed Integer Programming

## Reference

Many of these ideas are notes taken from Coursera's Discrete Optimization course.(Very awesome course, this is a course I would recommend to anyone interested in improving their problem solving abilities)

As part of the Coursera honor code, this repository will not contain any assignment code.
